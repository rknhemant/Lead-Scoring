# Lead_Scoring

Problem Statement
The X Education wanted to identify the potential leads which
can convert in to payment and focus on them. They wanted us
to build a model wherein each lead need to be assigned a
score such that the customers with higher lead score have a
higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead
score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular,
has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be
around 80%.

Business Goal
Building a logistic regression model to assign a lead
score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads. A lead with
higher score would mean Hot Lead is most likely to
convert and lower score lead would be the cold and will
mostly not get converted
There are some more problems presented by the
company with our model they should be able to adjust to
if the company's requirement changes in the future
